# Harsha-Portfolio 
        Over the pastfive years of experience, I've been actively involved in creating systems, interfaces, bots, and technological solutions to enhance the web. My focus is on writing and refining code that is clean, reusable, and scalable, following best practices and development standards. I specialize in  Angular, React, SQL and occasionally utilize .NET to contribute to elevating the overall quality of web development.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
